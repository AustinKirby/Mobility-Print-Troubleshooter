# Mobility Print Troubleshoot

This project was developed to help troubleshoot mobility print on Windows devices.

## Situation

There are multiple settings to check while troubleshooting devices that are having issues with
printing to the Mobility Print virtual queue. Firstly, a user is required to be logged into
the College internet. Secondly, the user is required to have Mobility Print installed on
their device. Firewalls or VPNs are known to effect in the intallation or use of
Mobility Print.

## Solution

To improve the troubleshooting process for printer technicains and the printer support team at Algonquin college, I developed this application. It checks the four known issues when using Mobility Print on Windows devices.
